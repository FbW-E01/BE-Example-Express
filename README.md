# Backend - Example (Express)

This is an example of a very small Express application. It also contains a `requests.http` file, which can be used with the VSCode "REST Client" extension to make an example request to the application once it is running.

- Usage:
1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. `node index.js`
